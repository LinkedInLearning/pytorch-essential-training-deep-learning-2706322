<p>PyTorch is the most flexible and expressive library for deep learning, and offers simple Python API, GPU support, and flexibility. Itâ€™s designed to load data, apply transforms, and build deep learning models with just a few lines of code. Many machine learning developers and researchers use PyTorch to accelerate deep learning research, experimentation, and prototyping. In this course, software developer Terezija Semenski teaches you the important features of PyTorch with a hands-on approach to help you develop the skills you need to dive into your deep learning projects.</p>
<p>This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.</p>
